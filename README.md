# Important
**THIS LIBARARY WILL NO LONGER BE SUPPORTED.** This library will no longer receieve updates as the v5 Kraken API has been depricated. For the new helix API, see my new [reprository](https://github.com/RokuHodo/TwitchNet). This will contain *only* the new API, not the kraken API. The repository will also contain resources for the IRC, PubSub, and Extension support when I get around to it.
